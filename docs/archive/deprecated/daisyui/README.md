# DaisyUI Deprecated Documentation

**Archived:** November 8, 2025
**Reason:** DaisyUI component library was removed on November 7, 2025

## What Happened

The project transitioned from DaisyUI to a custom CSS design system during the design system sprint (Nov 7, 2025). These files document the previous DaisyUI-based approach and are kept for historical reference only.

## Files in This Archive

- `DAISYUI_GUIDELINES.md` - DaisyUI component usage guidelines
- `FINAL_POLISH_CLEAN_DIVIDERS.md` - UI polish work using DaisyUI components

## Current Approach

For current design system documentation, see:
- [docs/architecture/04_Brand_Design_System.md](../../architecture/04_Brand_Design_System.md)
- [docs/reference/COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md](../../reference/COMPONENT_LIBRARY.md) (updated for custom CSS)
- [src/styles/global.css](../../../src/styles/global.css) - Source of truth for design tokens

## Why Archived, Not Deleted

These files provide context about design decisions and the evolution of the UI. If you need to understand why certain design choices were made, this historical context may be helpful.
