# Old Dashboard Documentation (Deprecated)

**Archived:** November 8, 2025
**Reason:** Architecture pivot from multi-tenant to self-hosted Git-first model

## What Happened

On November 6, 2025, the project underwent a major architecture pivot:
- **Old approach:** Multi-tenant, database-centric content storage
- **New approach:** Self-hosted, Git-first with GitHub as source of truth

These dashboard implementation guides were written for the old architecture and are no longer applicable.

## Why Archived, Not Deleted

These files represent significant planning and implementation work. While the specific technical approaches are outdated, they contain valuable context about:
- Design decisions and their rationale
- Problem-solving approaches
- Evolution of the product vision
- Lessons learned during development

If you're curious about why certain architectural choices were made or how the project evolved, these files provide historical context.
